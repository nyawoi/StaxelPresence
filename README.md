# What is StaxelPresence?

StaxelPresence is a client-side mod that allows players to share their in-game status on Discord via rich presence.

Wish you could share more details about your world with your friends?
Perhaps you'd like to know just how long you've been playing?
StaxelPresence is the mod for you!

# What does the mod add to Staxel?

StaxelPresence makes no changes to the game.
Instead, it provides the Discord desktop app with more details on your current playing session.

# What is planned for the future?

Future releases will include chat commands to toggle certain details from being shared,
as well as disabling rich presence for a world entirely.
If at all possible, allowing Discord users to request access to the game session would be a great addition.

# What does it mean to be a client-side mod?

Only the user(s) with the mod installed will be able to use its features.
If playing with friends, they will not be able to use the mod.
It is not required to be installed on the server,
and is actually discouraged (if on a dedicated server),
as it provides no additional features.
